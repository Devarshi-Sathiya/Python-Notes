Few Basics

-->	Suppose we take 

		string = "hello"

	then in all the code we have to use double quotation for defining the srings.
	
	In python the strings also can be declared by single quotaion.

		String = 'hello'	

	But whatever syntax you use, you have to follow it for all the program.	

-->	Another tricky point is when we define a string like this 

		string = " It's a nice day! "

	Why it didn't throw any error? It is using single quote in the double quoted statement.

	It didn't thrown any error due to the starting double quotes matched the ending double quotes.

	However if we define a string like 

		string = 'It's a nice day!'
	
	then we will get syntax error 

	to solve this just put a backslash

		string = 'It\'s a nice day!'

	known as escape character.

-->  Multi line statements: 
	
		if mynameisdevarshi == mynameispumpkin:
			Statement

	Instead of the above lines we can saparate it into multiple lines using backslashes 
	
		if mynameisdevarshi\
		==\
		mynameispumpkin:
			Statement

	This is just for ease of view nothing else.
